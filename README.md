# **Loan Prediction Project**

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the feasibility of granting loans to customers based on personal information and loan history. The prediction models utilized include KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Techniques such as Pipeline, Cross Validation, and Hyperparameter Tuning are implemented to enhance prediction performance, particularly focusing on maximizing recall metrics to prioritize accurate identification of loan-eligible customers.

### **Objective** ðŸŽ¯

This project is built to help analyze and predict the feasibility of giving loans to customers based on personal information such as personal information, loan history, etc.. The prediction model is built using four models namely, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and implements one of the Ensemble Learning namely Boosting to improve prediction performance. In these models, Pipeline, Cross Validation, and Hyperparameter Tunning will also be implemented according to the existing case study. The metrics used in the model are recall metrics, because the model is expected to be able to predict all data from customers who are eligible for loans and become the top priority, with the aim of maximizing the prediction of customers who are entirely eligible for loans.

### **Defining the Problem** ðŸ“Š

This project addresses the following objectives through data analysis and machine learning modeling:

1. **Dataset Overview:** Analyze a dataset of 614 records to understand customer demographics and loan histories.
2. **Data Preparation:** Handle missing values, eliminate duplicates, and split data into 409 training and 147 testing instances.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Compare KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost models based on cross-validation performance and bias.
4. **Performance Metrics:** Prioritize recall metrics to optimize detection of loan-eligible customers.
5. **Business Insights:** Extract actionable insights from model predictions to improve loan management and customer offerings.

### **Visualization and Analysis Tool** ðŸ“ˆ

For effective analysis and visualization of model performance, tools like Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) were utilized.

### **Conclusion and Business Insights** ðŸ“‰

Based on the analysis and prediction of customer loan eligibility using KNN and AdaBoost models:

- **Model Performance:** KNN and AdaBoost demonstrate superior performance in predicting loan eligibility with high recall scores.
- **Customer Insights:** Approximately 81.6% of customers in the test set are predicted to be eligible for loans.
- **Business Recommendations:** Use these insights to optimize loan management strategies, tailor product offerings, and mitigate default risks effectively.

Through this project, we aim to leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning to enhance loan decision-making processes and improve overall business outcomes. ðŸ’¼ðŸ’°
